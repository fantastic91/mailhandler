[Mailhandler](http://drupal.org/project/mailhandler) is a [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/8) module that allows you you to post nodes by email.
It is based on [Inmail](https://www.drupal.org/project/inmail) module. It takes mail (usually from an IMAP mailbox) and imports it as whatever type of content you choose. Beside the configured content type, you can specify the content type directly in your email subject. It enables you to select different authentication methods and mail analyzers.

Mailhandler Comment module allows you to post comments.

Hugely powerful and flexible, Mailhandler includes a demo module to help you get started.
